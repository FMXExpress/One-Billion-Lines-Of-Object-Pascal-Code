# One-Billion-Lines-Of-Object-Pascal-Code
One billion lines of object pascal code. Compiles in ~5 minutes on a 16 core AMD Ryzen 9 5950x.

The AMD Ryzen 9 5950x is a beast of a CPU with 16 cores and 32 threads. I have been running a bunch of benchmarks around one million lines of code but I wanted to really push the 5950x and Delphi to their limits so I created a group of projects in Delphi which combined have over one billion lines of code. Each project has a unit which contains 4 million lines of code and there are 250 projects. I loaded the projects up into Delphi Parallel Build which uses the parallel programming library in Delphi and away we go.
